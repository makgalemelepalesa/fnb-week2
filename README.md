# FNB Week 2 Project

## 📌 Description
This project was built during Week 2 of my learning journey in web development. It is a simple web page layout inspired by FNB’s website design. The goal was to practice structuring a webpage using HTML and styling it with CSS.

## 💡 What I Learned
- Creating and organizing HTML page sections (header, main, footer)
- Styling layouts using CSS classes and IDs
- Using margins, padding, and colors to improve design
- Linking buttons and navigation elements

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the page

## 📚 Future Plans
- Make the layout responsive for mobile devices
- Add animations or hover effects
- Improve accessibility (alt text, semantic tags)

✨ This project is part of my journey to becoming a frontend developer. I’m learning one step at a time and building as I go!
